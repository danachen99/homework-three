## Random Password Generator

The purpose of this project is to create a random password generator. The characters included are special characters, lower case letters, uppercase letters, and numeric values. 

The application contains an alert for the user when they input a number outside of the parameters (8 and 128) and when the user tries to generate a password without entering a value.
