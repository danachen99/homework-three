## Random Password Generator

The purpose of this project is to create a random password generator. The characters included are special characters, lower case letters, uppercase letters, and numeric values. It is important that passwords be at least eigth characters long so that they are harder to guess/penetrate, especially if it's made up of upper and lowercase letters and numbers and/or symbols. The combination of various types of characters creates a strong password compared to a weak password containing only letters. 

The application contains an alert for the user when they input a number outside of the parameters (8 and 128) and when the user tries to generate a password without entering a value.
